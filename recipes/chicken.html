<p>This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite Indian dishes. It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.</p> 

<ul>
     <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil, divided</li>
     <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
     <li>¼ white onion, chopped</li>

</ul>

<ol>
     <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Sauté shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
     <li>Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to frequently stir.</li>
     <li>Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, frequently stirring. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
